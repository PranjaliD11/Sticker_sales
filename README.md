# Sticker Sales Prediction

## Introduction

Predicting the number of stickers sold is crucial for understanding market demand and optimizing inventory. This project leverages machine learning techniques to forecast sticker sales based on various features, such as country, product type, and sales history. In the initial version sticker_sales_V1.ipynb, we have applied linear regression with one-hot encoding for categorical variables, we achieve an accuracy of approximately 70%.
