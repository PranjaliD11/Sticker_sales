# Sticker Sales Prediction

## Introduction

Predicting the number of stickers sold is crucial for understanding market demand and optimizing inventory. This project leverages machine learning techniques to forecast sticker sales based on various features, such as country, product type, and sales history. In the initial version sticker_sales_V1.ipynb, we have applied linear regression with one-hot encoding for categorical variables, we achieve an accuracy of approximately 70%.

## Methodology
To build this predictive model, I've followed these key steps:

1.**Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding, and normalizing numerical values.

2.**Feature Engineering**: Selected relevant features, including country, product type, and past sales performance.

3.**Model Selection**: Implemented a linear regression model, a fundamental statistical technique for regression tasks.

4.**Training & Evaluation**: Split the data into training and testing sets, trained the model, and evaluated its performance using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
